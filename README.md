## hello

Networking, web, security & a bit of everything else

This is a collection of projects demonstrating my experience using various technologies. Most projects are recently made/updated

All projects and logic belongs 100% to me. No AI has been used, projects haven't been copypasted from tutorials/courses/stackoverflow or anything else. Of course, as any developer does - you need to look things up online, but there's no plagiarism involved.

For any type of inquiry, my email address is 20001andrei@gmail.com or we can connect on linkedin using the link in my bio.
